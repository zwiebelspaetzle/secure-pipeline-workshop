#
# Steampipe is a SQL-based infrastructure analysis tool for cloud platforms
# Repository: https://github.com/turbot/steampipe
#
# PREREQUISITES:
# - An AWS IAM role with the following policies:
#   - `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit`
#   - `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess`
#     - More info about it in https://steampipe.io/docs/aws/setup
# - Configure role arn as Repository Secret, called `AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN`
# - Configure AWS Region as Repository Variable, called `AWS_REGION`
# - Configure AWS IAM Role Session Duration as Repository Variable (default: 3600 seconds), called `AWS_IAM_ROLE_SESSION_DURATION`
#
# TO USE THIS JOB:
# 1. Copy this entire job definition into .github/workflows/runtime-infra-scan.yml
# 2. Replace the current jobs: definition with this one
